/u2/emacs/dist now contains version 16.57, which differs from 16.56
in having fixes to all the significant bugs discovered since 16.56
came out.  It is still a little experimental, and there may
possibly be a 16.58 in a couple of days.  /u2/emacs/edist.tar is
also 16.57.  I will prepare a set of diffs in a few hours.
